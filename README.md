### liveProject: Prototying Prototyping self-driving agents in OpenAI Gym with Reinforcement Learning

This the github repository contains implementations for _liveProject: Prototyping self-driving agents with OpenAI with Reinforcement Learning_ for reference purposes. This repositories includes the following implementation as must in the stated directory structure.

#### Agent implementations for a given milestone

* __Milestone 1:__ Oriented for designing model based learning agents.
  * Value Iteration and Policy Iteration implementation for _'MountainCar-v0'_ environment of OpenAI.
  * Value Iteration implementation for lane changing task of third party _highway-env_ environment.
  * __Assignment Task:__ Implementation of Epsilon-Greedy Policy for lane merging task on third party _highway-env_ environment.

* __Milestone 2:__ Improving the agents performance with model free learning.
  * _Monte Carlo Off-Policy Control with Importance Sampling_ implementation for _'MountainCar-v0'_ environment of OpenAI.
  * Model free Temporal Learning agent implementation for 'CarRacing-v0'.
    * __Assignment Task:__ Implementation of Model free Temporal Learning agent for lane changing task on third party _highway-env_ environment.

* __Milestone 3:__ Designing plan oriented that uses searching capabilities to navigate across optimal path.
  * Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) Implementation for _'MountainCar-v0'_ environment.
  * MCTS implementation for highway-env lane changing task on third party _highway-env_ environment.
  * __Final Assignment:__ MCTS implementation for agent successfully completing parking task for `highway-env` environment.
  
By working on these 10 different implementation tasks we learn upon importance of different relatively unexplored paradigms in reinforcement learning which are not part of current state of the art methodologies but still relevant in certain specific scenarios.
